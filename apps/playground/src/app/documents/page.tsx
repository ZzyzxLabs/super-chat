// Everything below runs with no model and no network. That is not a limitation
// of the demo, it is the point of the module: the hard parts of in-chat editing
// are ADDRESSING (which text does this edit mean?) and REFUSAL (what happens
// when the answer is "more than one" or "none"?), and both are decided by pure
// functions over a string. So they can be exercised directly, and a developer
// evaluating the framework can make them fail on purpose — which is the only
// way to see the half of `applyEdits` that matters.
//
// The other panels answer "what can the agent show you". This one answers "what
// stops the agent from quietly changing the wrong paragraph".

Two suppliers, scored against the March criteria.

## Findings

The cheaper option fails SSO. On a three-year horizon that is not a saving.

| Supplier | Annual | SSO | Notice |
|:---------|-------:|:---:|:-------|
| Northwind | 42,000 | yes | 60 days |
| Contoso   | 31,500 | no  | 90 days |

> Contoso's contract has no cap on the renewal uplift.

## Recommendation

1. Award to Northwind.
2. Ask Contoso for a capped renewal and re-score in September.

renewal = 2027-03-01
notice  = 90d
