          A card is a structured tool output the host renders as UI. Two ways one appears: a domain tool attaches it to
          its result, or the agent calls <code className="al-mono">visualize</code> and picks a presentation itself —
          which is what makes it visually flexible rather than limited to what someone pre-built. Each kind below is
          shown with the exact spec that produced it.

            actually steer the choice. Kinds are registered with their validator and renderer together; a test asserts
            the two sets match exactly, so a card can never validate with nowhere to render.
