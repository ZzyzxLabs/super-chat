// Demo skills across three unrelated domains.

// Three domains rather than one on purpose: the point of a skill registry is
// that ONE agent covers several fields and only pays for the one the message is
// about. A single-domain demo hides that entirely — and worse, it makes the
// framework look like it was built for that domain.
