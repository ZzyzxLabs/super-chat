// The quote bus: previewer → composer.
//
// Without it a host has to wire DocumentCardView's onQuote into its own state
// and hand that back to Composer as a prop — for a gesture the user thinks of
// as one action. That wiring is exactly the friction this feature exists to
// remove, so the kit does it.
//
// It lives in packages/ui rather than packages/react because both ends are UI
// components, and routing it through the client layer would make the kit's
// component tree depend on a store it does not otherwise need. The provider is
// optional: DocumentCardView without one simply does not offer quoting, which
// is the correct degradation for a host that renders documents but wants no
// composer integration.
