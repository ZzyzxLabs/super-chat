// Agent cards — the agent's visual vocabulary.
//
// A card is a structured tool output that the host renders as UI instead of as
// JSON. Two ways one gets produced:
//   • a DOMAIN tool attaches a card to its result ("here are the pools I found"), or
//   • the agent calls the generic `visualize` tool and CHOOSES a presentation.
// The second is what makes the agent visually flexible rather than limited to
// whatever cards someone hard-coded.
//
// Three design rules, each learned from a real failure mode:
//
//  1. Validator and renderer are registered TOGETHER (registry.ts). In a
//     hand-maintained dispatch chain, adding a payload parser and forgetting the
//     render branch degrades the card to a bare "ran ✓" chip — silently, in
//     production, and only for that one card.
//
//  2. Interactive cards are never collapsible. A card that asks for a decision
//     (confirm, pick, fill) is part of the conversation's control flow; hiding
//     it inside a "3 steps completed" accordion makes it unreachable, which
//     reads to the user as the agent hanging.
//
//  3. Cards carry their own `expired` state. Card payloads are large and often
//     trimmed out of persisted history; a reloaded thread must say "this result
//     expired, ask again" rather than rendering an empty shell.
