// An async event channel: push from a callback, consume as an async iterable.
//
// Needed because tool execution is a plain `await`, not a generator, yet some
// events MUST reach the UI while a tool is still running:
//
//   • `awaiting-user` — a card asking for a decision. Buffering this until the
//     tool resolves deadlocks: the tool waits for the user, the user waits for
//     the card, and the card waits for the tool.
//   • `card` — progress updates from a long-running tool.
//
// Collecting events into an array and yielding them afterwards looks equivalent
// and is not. This is the fix.
