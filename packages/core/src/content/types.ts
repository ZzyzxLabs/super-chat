// The normalized content model. EVERYTHING in agentloom — history, tool output,
// attachments, provider replies — is expressed as `Message[]` of `ContentPart[]`.

// Why a normalized model at all: each provider has its own wire shape for the
// same idea (an image is `input_image` in OpenAI Responses, `image_url` in Chat
// Completions, `{type:"image", source:{...}}` in Anthropic). If the app layer
// spoke any one of those, swapping providers would rewrite the app. Adapters own
// the translation; nothing above `providers/` may reference a wire field.

 * different provider instead of sending a 400-guaranteed request.
