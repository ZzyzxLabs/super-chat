// The document seam.
//
// A document is none of the five things this framework already persists, and
// the mismatch is not cosmetic:
//
//   ThreadStore   the transcript. A document outlives its thread and must not
//                 be trimmed by compaction.
//   FileStore     IMMUTABLE provider refs. A document changes; every edit would
//                 invalidate the id that made uploading worthwhile.
//   MemoryStore   loose facts, with no notion of position — nothing to address.
//   Retriever     read-only.
//   app-state     a snapshot of the screen, and its own header rules out
//                 "diffing, CRDT, bidirectional sync".
//
// That last exclusion is right for UI state and wrong for documents, which is
// why this is a separate module rather than an app-state binding: for a
// document the diff IS the product, because it is what the user approves.
//
// The host owns storage. The framework owns the model, the edit protocol and
// the approval surface — the same division Transport draws when it refuses to
// hold a credential.
